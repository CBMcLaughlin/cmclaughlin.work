            Designed and implemented a comprehensive home network architecture
            leveraging VLANs and subnet segmentation to isolate three distinct
            zones: primary home network, public-facing services, and an IP
            camera surveillance system. Deployed a complete dual-stack
            environment by configuring IPv4 address pools with DHCP services
            alongside IPv6 infrastructure utilizing NDP and prefix delegation.
            Secured the network through L4 firewall rulesets that combine
            stateless packet filtering and stateful connection tracking,
            enabling precise inter-VLAN communication while maintaining strict
            security boundaries between network segments.
